        Im a huge soccer fan. Theres nothing that compares to actually playing, but watching it is a great excuse
        to get real mad and yell at a TV. I also love working out. I try to make it a habit to hit the gym at least
        5 times a week, and I'll talk your ear off about routines/dieting/exercises.
